				If you're looking for a fantastic way to stay in shape and you love being on the water, rowing is perfect for you. Alternatively, most gyms provide indoor rowing machines.
				Rowing in a small group requires precise co-ordination and excellent communication skills, so not only will you get fit, but also make some good friends in the process
				</p>
			
				<p>
					The rowing stroke may be characterized by two fundamental reference points. The catch, which is placement of the oar blade in the water, and the extraction, also known as the finish or release, when the rower removes the oar blade from the water. The action between catch and release is the first phase of the stroke that propels the boat.

				CARDIO! CARDIO! CARDIO!
				 The adjustable resistance on most rowers lets you easily work up to your target heart rate as well as slow back down to your resting rate.
				No matter what your age is, a fitness plan that includes cardio (or aerobic exercise) is an important contributor to your overall health.
				All rowing requires the use of so many major muscle groups, a rowing machine is an effective way to raise your heart rate and increase your oxygen intake 
				for an effective cardio workout.
			
					</p>
			
				<p>
					And on top of that, you can challenge yourself by increasing the resistance as you become a more seasoned rower.
					Once you become a pro, you’ll be feeling so good that hopping on
					your rowing machine will be a treat!
					blow out the speakers and row to the beat of your favorite tracks, put your favorite show on the TV, or recruit a workout buddy for extra encouragement. 
					If exercising is something you dread, it is a lot harder to motivate yourself to do it. Making a fitness plan that you enjoy is your key to success. Because rowing works out your 
					entire body, it’s easier to stay engaged while doing it.
